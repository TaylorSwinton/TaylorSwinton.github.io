As someone who has followed along with the tech community before joining Flatiron School, it's not unlikely that I became privy to a couple tech phrases. One of them being called the *"imposter syndrome"*, this phrase sounds just like how it would be defined. Someone who has entered a community and feels as if they don't belong. Don't get me wrong Flatiron has been one of the most inclusive tech communties i've ever participated in. 

It's the code that can make anyone feel that way. The frustration of not being able to understand a concept can slowly nag at the back of your mind. Which reseults in you doubting your abilties, overlooking the simple answers because you're stuck in one spot overcomplicating the problem at hand. Once you've reached the epitone of confusion things only seem to get a little more difficult. Suddenly, you question if this can really be done or calling yourself crazy because you started a journey of new learning that's got your brain all tied up.

When this happens...shut everything down, get up and do something else. Working under pressure is something that a lot of people can do but that doesn't mean it should be done. Processing things under pressure has never truly been the most ideal way to handle situations, so why do it to yourself on your OWN project. Realign yourself and RELAX, the answer is there and you're not an imposter you're just a little confused. The best part about tech is that you're learning everyday, there's never going to be a moment when you're stagnant. Learning has never been linear and if you're truly learning then there is going to be roadblocks, you just have to figure out a creative way to get past them.

Imposter syndrome was my biggest roadblock when I was working on my Sinatra app, it was difficult the whole way through but the pay off of being able to say I finished was worth it. With the help of my Instructur, cohurt, and well needed time away from the computer, I was able to finish and still feel proud of what I had created. My biggest lesson from this section of learning was that I'm not going to be able to understand everything quickly. Some things will need time, review, and practice.

I hope my experience helps others know that it's not just about the code but how you approach the situation.
